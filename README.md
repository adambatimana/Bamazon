mySql Database with table for application should be created.

The first step of this application is to display all items that are for sale.

</p>

Then the next step would be to use inquirer to prompt two question, "Which Item Would You like To buy?" and "How Many Would You Like To Buy"?

If the process is complete then the database should be updated and the console should show a message to confirm the order was done properly.

If the database does not have enough items the console will log the messages "INSUFFICIENT QUANTITY!"
